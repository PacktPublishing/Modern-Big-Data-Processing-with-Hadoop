# Modern Big Data Processing with Hadoop
This is the code repository for [Modern Big Data Processing with Hadoop](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/modern-big-data-processing-hadoop?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787122765), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The complex structure of data these days requires sophisticated solutions for data transformation, to make the information more accessible to the users.This book empowers you to build such solutions with relative ease with the help of Apache Hadoop, along with a host of other Big Data tools.

This book will give you a complete understanding of the data lifecycle management with Hadoop, followed by modeling of structured and unstructured data in Hadoop.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
su - hadoop
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ras.pub hadoop@namenode
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ras.pub hadoop@datanode1
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ras.pub hadoop@datanode2
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ras.pub hadoop@datanode3
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
exi
```

This book is for big data professionals who want to fast-track their career in the Hadoop industry and become expert big data architects. Project managers and mainframe professionals looking forward to build a career in big data and Hadoop will also find this book useful. Some understanding of Hadoop is required to get the best out of this book.
